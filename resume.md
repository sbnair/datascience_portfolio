    Mobile app was developed in both Android and iOS to conduct and manage running sports from any location each user chooses, multiplayer gaming information had to be maintained by a JBOSS Server which contains Java + Spring + Hibernate + Apache Ignite + Oracle 10g skill set. Apache Ignite had In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) which was very useful in calculating running statistics as there was a huge data that needs to be analyzed in memory without any delay.

    Adding more Apache Ignite nodes and having distributed ACID transactions with distributed structures like id generator, Queue and Set Operators have helped apps to perform in a very efficient way especially to display running statistics of different participants.
